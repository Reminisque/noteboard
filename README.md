# Noteboard

Noteboard is a note-taking application built around the React front-end framework and Firebase. Within Firebase's infrastructure, this application uses Firestore as the database to store all notes.

## Before running the application

* Make sure that `npm` is installed
* Open terminal, navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Replace template in `config.js` (found in `src` folder) with your Firebase project configuation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
