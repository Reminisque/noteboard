# Noteboard

Noteboard is a note-taking application built around the React front-end framework and Firebase. Within Firebase's infrastructure, this application uses Firestore as the database to store all notes.

## Before running the application

* Make sure that `npm` is installed
* Open terminal, navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Create `config.js` file with following code inside `src` folder and replace template with your Firebase project configuation
```
var config = {
  firebase: {
    apiKey: "__API_KEY__",
    authDomain: "__AUTH_DOMAIN__",
    databaseURL: "__DATABASE_URL__",
    projectId: "__PROJECT_ID__",
    storageBucket: "__STORAGE_BUCKET__",
    messagingSenderId: "__MESSAGING_SENDER_ID__",
    appId: "__FIREBASE_APP_ID__"
  }
}

export default config;
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
